This is a collection of projects I have worked on. 

The ODE/PDE branch is a collection of excersies and examples where I implemented numerical methods myself for practice.
This includes verifying error estimatesfor grid refinements. These examples are quick implementations for practice and studying. Code was written to become more familiar with math libraries.

The SDE branch is a collection of code that I implemented for a presentation I did in a topics course on SDEs. 
This includes verifying error estimates satisfied expectations for Euler and Milstein methods for weak and strong convergence.

The Jordan Canonical Form calculator is a project I worked on to become familiar with math libraries for Python.
Even though this can be done with the same libraries, this porject was choosen to be sufficiently difficult so that 
the implementation challenged my abilites at the time.
